# Take-Home Coding Exercise

Welcome to the coding exercise! The goal of this project is to demonstrate your skills by building an app that displays a set of locations on a map in a performant manner. Please follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.

## Project Overview

This exercise involves fetching data from a JSON file stored in this repository and implementing a map view to display locations. You'll need to implement features like filtering locations by type and displaying additional information when a location is tapped.

## Instructions

1. **Fork the Repository:**
    - Please begin by forking this repository.
    - All of your changes should be committed to your fork.
    - Optional: Use pull requests with short descriptions to help explain as you go through

2. **Setup Project:**
    - Create an `android` or `ios` folder respectively in the root of this folder. This is where your project will live.

3. **Fetch Location Data:**
    - The repository contains a JSON file, `locations.json`, that lists various locations.
    - Use the raw file content feature of GitHub for fetching data (think of it as a mock API). Please point it to your forked repository, not the Voze repository.
        - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME>/coding-exercises/master/mobile/map-locations/locations.json`
    - Your task is to parse this file and use the data within the app.

4. **Display Locations on a Map View:**
    - Create a map view in the app as the main view.
        - The data is centered around San Francisco. Please set the default location to there.
    - Plot the locations from the JSON file on the map using pins or markers.

5. **Filtering Locations:**
    - Implement a way to filter the displayed locations by `location_type`.
        - The assumption can be made the location_types are a static set and will not change.
        - You can provide a UI (e.g., dropdown menu, segmented control, etc) that allows users to select which types of locations to display on the map.
        - Please feel free to "steal" existing UI from other application such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, Zillow, etc for filtering or craft your own.
        - Optional: Distinguish between location types through the presentation of pin or markers.

6. **Additional Details on Tap:**
   - When a user taps on a location pin, show a view with more detailed information about that location.
        - Display all `attributes` inside this detail view.
        - Please feel free to "steal" existing UI from other application such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, Zillow, etc for details or craft your own.

## Requirements

- **Documentation:**
    - Please add any contextual implementation information into Implementation section at the bottom of this `README`.
    - Add code comments when relevant
    - Add information on how to get the application up and running into the Getting Started section at the bottom of this `README`.
- **Programming Language:**
    - iOS: Please focus on using Swift
    - Android: Please focus on using Kotlin (Java is still acceptable, however Kotlin is preferred)
- **Data Fetching:**
    - You may use the std library or a 3rd party library for making HTTP request.
        - If using a 3rd party library please explain why inside the Implementation section at the bottom of this `README`.
- **Map Integration:**
    - You may use any mapping library, such as MapKit
    - Please do not use a mapping library which requires an API key
- **UI/UX:**
    - Design a user-friendly interface to interact with the map and filter locations.
    - Keep it simple. This isn't a exercise to test your design skill.
- **Filtering:**
    - Implement efficient filtering of locations by their type.

## Submission

1. Once you have completed the exercise email a link to the forked repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness:** Does the app fetch and display data correctly?
- **UI/UX:** Is the map view intuitive and easy to use (within reason given lack of design criteria)?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, readable, follow modern architecture per environment, and well-structured?
- **Filtering:** Is filtering by location type implemented efficiently?
- **Attention to Detail:** Does the app show detailed information when a pin is tapped?

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Good luck, and happy coding!

## Getting Started

Launch mobile/SFLocations/SFLocations.xcodeproj. Build and run in a simulator of your choice or run Previews for MapView.


## Implementation

I included some comments around how the implementation could be done differently given differe scenarios, requirements etc.
